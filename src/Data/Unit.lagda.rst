  module Data.Unit where

An empty record type is a record type with no fields. Unit is the
"official" empty record type whose constructor is named tt (trivially
true). It is the terminal object (up to isomorphism) in the category Sets::

  open import Agda.Builtin.Unit public

  Unit = ⊤

The trivial function is evidence that Unit satisfies the universal property
of terminal objects in the category Sets. You can also think of it as the
unfold operation for Unit::

  trivial : {X : Set} -> X -> Unit
  trivial _ = tt

A thunk is a value wrapped inside a function that takes "no arguments". Another
way to think about thunk is as the fold operation for Unit (considered
as a set with one constructor)::

  thunk : {X : Set} -> X -> Unit -> X
  thunk x tt = x

The inverse of thunk is unthunk. Together, these two functions witness
an isomorphism between Unit -> X and X. They also prove that the identity
functor id {{Sets}} is representable by Unit::

  unthunk : {X : Set} -> (Unit -> X) -> X
  unthunk x = x tt
